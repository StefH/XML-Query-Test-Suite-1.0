# XML Query Test Suite 1.0
The XML Query Test Suite 1.0 (XQTS) provides a set of metrics for determining whether the W3C XML Query Language can be implemented interoperably as published. XQTS will help implementers identify possible problems both with the Specification and with their software. The test suite is occasionally updated to reflect the current work of the W3C XML Query Working Group and the W3C XSL Working Group; all releases of the XQTS will be available from this page.
